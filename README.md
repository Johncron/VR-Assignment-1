--Bonus--
I added a script that changes the color of the material on each object to a random color in the Start method.

Scene 2
This scene contains a maze made up of resized cubes, a capsule object as the player and a camera that follows the player.  The player has a player controller script that reads wasd and arrow key inputs to move the object.

--Difficulties--
I encountered a persistent error involving the Android SDK and related dependencies.  I am not sure why it caused such an error, maybe the Meta headset is an Android device.  I fixed the error by going into the build settings and downloading everything for Android, even though the project is intended for Windows, Mac, Linux.
